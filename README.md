# go-keepkey #

go-keepkey is a client library and CLI for interacting with Keepkey storage devices.  
This library is unofficial and in development. For the official client see https://github.com/keepkey/python-keepkey

## Dependencies ##
Since the device has transitioned to communicating over webUSB you need install libusb for your platform
	
	brew install libusb

## Installation ##


	go get -u github.com/solipsis/go-keepkey
	go install github.com/solipsis/go-keepkey

## Usage ##

```go
import "github.com/solipsis/go-keepkey/keepkey"
```

### Connect to all connected Keepkey devices ###

```go
devices, err := keepkey.GetDevices()

// Get the features supported by the first connected device
kk := devices[0]
features, err := kk.GetFeatures()
```

### Wipe the device and load with new seed words and settings ###

```go
kk.WipeDevice() // Error ignored

// Settings
words := "water wink explain proof size gift silly sort collect differ anger yard"
pin := "123"
label := "test"
usePassphrase := false
useChecksum := false 

kk.LoadDevice(strings.Split(words, " "), pin, label, usePassphrase, useChecksum)
```
### Upload custom firmware ###
```go
path := "path/to/firmware.bin"
numBtyes, err := kk.UploadFirmware(path)
```

### Sign an ethereum transaction ###
```go
var nonce uint64 = 20
recipient := "0x6b68c94fc31A10707f9c0f1281aad5ec9a4eeff0" 
amount := big.NewInt(1337)   
gasLimit := big.NewInt(80000)
gasPrice := big.NewInt(22000000000)
data := []byte{}

// Create the transaction
tx := NewTransaction(nonce, recipient, amount, gasLimit, gasPrice, data)                                                     

// Ask the device to sign the transaction
tx, err := kk.EthereumSignTx(ethPath, tx)                                                                                                                                                                                           
if err != nil {                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
        log.Fatalf("Unable to sign tx: %s", err)

// Encode the transaction as raw transaction hex string															     
raw, err := tx.ToRawTransaction()

        log.Fatalf("Unable to convert to raw tx:", err)

fmt.Println(raw)

### Get an ethereum address for a BIP44 node ###
```go
nodePath := []uint32{0x8000002C, 0x8000003C, 0x80000000, 0x0, 0x01} // m/44'/60'/0'/0/1
display := true // display the address and QR code on the device screen

kk.EthereumGetAddress(nodePath, display)
```

### Get entropy sample from the device RNG ###
```go
var entropy []byte
size := 1024 // number of bytes of entropy to request up to 1024 bytes
entropy, err := kk.GetEntropy(size)
```

## Development ##

### Regenerating Protobufs ###

Fetch the latest submoduled version

	git submodule update --init --recursive

This project uses [retool](https://github.com/twitchtv/retool) to vendor tools such as protoc

	go get github.com/twitchtv/retool
	
Once retool is installed you can regenerate the protobufs using (from the project root)

	retool do go generate ./...
